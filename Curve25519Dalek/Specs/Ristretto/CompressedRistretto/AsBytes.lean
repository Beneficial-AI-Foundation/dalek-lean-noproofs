natural language description:

    • Extract the byte representation of type [u8;32] from a CompressedRistretto.
      Since CompressedRistretto is defined as a type alias for Array U8 32#usize,
      this is essentially just an identity operation that returns the underlying byte array.

natural language specs:

    • The operation never panics (always returns successfully)
    • as_bytes(cr) = cr, i.e., the function is the identity operation
