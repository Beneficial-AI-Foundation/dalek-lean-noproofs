/-! # Spec Theorems for `RistrettoPoint::mul`

Specifications and proofs for scalar multiplication of Ristretto points.

Two trait implementations are covered here:

- `Shared0RistrettoPoint.Insts.CoreOpsArithMulSharedAScalarRistrettoPoint.mul`:
  `&RistrettoPoint * &Scalar → RistrettoPoint`, delegating to `edwards.EdwardsPoint.Insts.CoreOpsArithMulSharedBScalarEdwardsPoint.mul`.

- `Shared0Scalar.Insts.CoreOpsArithMulSharedARistrettoPointRistrettoPoint.mul` — the commutative variant:
  `&Scalar * &RistrettoPoint → RistrettoPoint`, independently delegating to `SharedAScalar.Insts.CoreOpsArithMulEdwardsPointEdwardsPoint.mul`.

natural language description:

• Takes a valid Ristretto point (self : RistrettoPoint) and a canonical scalar (scalar : scalar.Scalar)
• Returns the scalar multiple [scalar]self, i.e., the point added to itself scalar times
• Delegates to edwards.EdwardsPoint.Insts.CoreOpsArithMulSharedBScalarEdwardsPoint.mul since RistrettoPoint
  is represented as an underlying EdwardsPoint

natural language specs:

• The function always succeeds (no panic) for valid input RistrettoPoints r and canonical Scalars s
• The result is a valid RistrettoPoint
• The result = r + ... + r represents the input RistrettoPoint r added to itself s-times

Note:

One RistrettoPoint r corresponds to an equivalence class of several
mathematical curve points.

The command r.toPoint thus maps r to one of these concrete representatives on the curve (to the representative
that currently just so happens to represent r).

The equation

result.toPoint = (U8x32_as_Nat s.bytes) • r.toPoint

thus assures that the concrete representative of the input RistrettoPoints r on the curve sums up to
the concrete representative of the output Ristretto point on the curve if mathematically added to itself s times.
Since the addition on RistrettoPoints is mathematically well-defined (i.e., it does not depend on the choice of representatives), the condition

result.toPoint = (U8x32_as_Nat s.bytes) • r.toPoint

thus indeed implies that the output RistrettoPoint (seen as an equivalence class) is the mathematically correct sum
of r + ... + r (s-times), even though we are only working at the level of (fairly arbitrary) representatives.

The fact that the addition of RistrettoPoints is indeed well-defined and does not depend on the chosen
representatives follows from standard results in abstract algebra: in any set of left cosets G/N, the product

(aN)(bN)=(ab)N

constitutes a well-defined operation that does not depend on the chosen representatives a, b iff N is a normal subgroup;
and in an Abelian group (our elliptic curve group is Abelian), every subgroup is normal.
