/-! # Spec Theorem for `RistrettoPoint::conditional_select`

Specification and proof for the `ConditionallySelectable` trait implementation for `RistrettoPoint`.

This function conditionally selects between two Ristretto points based on a `Choice` value
by delegating to the underlying Edwards point conditional selection, which in turn applies
`FieldElement51::conditional_select` component-wise to the coordinates (X, Y, Z, T).

Returns `b` when `choice = 1` and `a` when `choice = 0`, in constant time.

natural language description:

- Takes two RistrettoPoints `a` and `b` and a `Choice` value
- Returns one of the two points based on the choice, in constant time
- Implementation: delegates to `EdwardsPoint::conditional_select`, which applies
  `FieldElement51::conditional_select` component-wise to the coordinates (X, Y, Z, T)

natural language specs:

- The function always succeeds (no panic)
- Returns `b` when `choice = 1` and `a` when `choice = 0`
