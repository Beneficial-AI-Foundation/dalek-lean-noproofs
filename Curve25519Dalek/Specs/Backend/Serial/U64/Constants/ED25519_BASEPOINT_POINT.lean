natural language description:

    • ED25519_BASEPOINT_POINT is the standard Ed25519 basepoint,
      which serves as the generator point for the prime order subgroup of the Ed25519 elliptic curve group.
    • This constant is used as the base point for scalar multiplication operations in Ed25519.

natural language specs:

    • ED25519_BASEPOINT_POINT is a valid Edwards point (which amongst other things implies that it fulfills the curve equation)
    • ED25519_BASEPOINT_POINT is of prime order L
