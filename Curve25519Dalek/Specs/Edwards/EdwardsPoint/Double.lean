/-! # Spec Theorem for `EdwardsPoint::double`

Specification and proof for `EdwardsPoint::double`.

This function doubles an Edwards point (adds it to itself) using elliptic curve point addition.

**Source**: curve25519-dalek/src/edwards.rs

## TODO
- Complete proof

natural language description:

• Takes an EdwardsPoint and returns the result of adding the point to itself via elliptic curve
point addition (i.e., computes P + P where P is the input point)

• The implementation converts the point to projective coordinates, performs the doubling
operation in projective space, then converts back to extended (= Edwards) coordinates

natural language specs:

• The function always succeeds (no panic)
• Returns an EdwardsPoint that represents P + P (elliptic curve addition) if the input was P

/-- **Spec and proof concerning `edwards.EdwardsPoint.double`**:
- No panic (always returns successfully)
- Returns the doubled point 2P (= P + P in elliptic curve addition) where P is the input EdwardsPoint
