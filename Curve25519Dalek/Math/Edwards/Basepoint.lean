/-! # Ed25519 Basepoint Order

This file contains the purely mathematical facts related to the ed25519 basepoint, independent of
any implementation representation.

Key results:
- `basepoint ≠ 0`
- `4 • basepoint ≠ 0`
- `L • basepoint = 0`

/-- The Ed25519 basepoint has order L, i.e., L • basepoint = 0.

This is verified computationally using double-and-add scalar multiplication via `native_decide`. -/
